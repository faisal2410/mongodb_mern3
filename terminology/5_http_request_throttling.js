HTTP request throttling is a technique used to control the rate at which HTTP requests are sent or received by a server or client in order to prevent overload or abuse. There are several ways to implement HTTP request throttling, but one common technique is rate limiting.

Rate limiting involves limiting the number of requests that can be sent or received in a given time period. For example, you might limit requests to 100 per minute. Let's take a look at how to implement this in Node.js using the express-rate-limit middleware.

First, install the express-rate-limit package by running the following command in your terminal:


npm install express-rate-limit

Next, import the express-rate-limit middleware into your Node.js application:


const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

Then, create a rate limiter object that specifies the maximum number of requests allowed in a given time period, like so:


const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

This code creates a rate limiter object that limits each IP address to 100 requests per minute. You can adjust the windowMs and max properties to suit your specific needs.

Finally, apply the rate limiter to your Express app using the app.use() method:


const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(limiter);

This code applies the rate limiter to your entire Express app. Any requests that exceed the rate limit will receive a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP response code.

That's a basic example of how to implement HTTP request throttling using rate limiting in Node.js. There are many other techniques and strategies for implementing request throttling, depending on your specific needs and constraints.
