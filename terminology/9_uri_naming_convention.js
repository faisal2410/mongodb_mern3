/*
In the MERN stack, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are used to identify resources that can be accessed via HTTP. A URI consists of several components, including a scheme, a hostname, a port, a path, and a query string. The path component of a URI is used to identify a specific resource on the server.

Here are some URI naming conventions that are commonly used in the MERN stack:

Use lowercase letters: URI paths should be all lowercase to avoid confusion and ensure consistency. For example, instead of /Users, you should use /users.

Use hyphens as separators: Use hyphens as word separators in URI paths, instead of underscores or camelCase. For example, instead of /userProfile, you should use /user-profile.

Use plural nouns for collections: Use plural nouns in the URI path to indicate a collection of resources. For example, instead of /user, you should use /users.

Use HTTP verbs for actions: Use HTTP verbs to indicate the action being taken on a resource. For example, use GET to retrieve data, POST to create data, PUT to update data, and DELETE to delete data.

Here's an example URI naming convention that follows these guidelines:


GET /api/users/:id

In this example, we're using the GET verb to retrieve a specific user resource by its ID. The URI path is /api/users/:id, where :id is a parameter that represents the ID of the user. Using a parameter in the URI path allows us to specify a dynamic value, such as the ID of the user we want to retrieve.

Another example:


POST /api/users
In this example, we're using the POST verb to create a new user resource. The URI path is /api/users, which represents the collection of users on the server.

Using consistent URI naming conventions in the MERN stack makes it easier to understand and maintain your application, especially as it grows in size and complexity.
