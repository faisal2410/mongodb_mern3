In software development, the term "client-side" typically refers to the code that runs in the user's web browser, as opposed to "server-side" code that runs on the web server. Client-side code is typically written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and is responsible for creating the user interface, handling user interactions, and making requests to the server for data or other resources.

Client-side code is responsible for managing the user experience and rendering the content on the screen. It communicates with the server using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to fetch data or perform actions without requiring the user to reload the page.

Examples of client-side technologies include popular front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which provide a set of tools and conventions for building complex user interfaces. Other client-side technologies include CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, which provide pre-built styles and components to make it easier to create consistent, responsive layouts.

Client-side programming has become increasingly important in modern web development, as more and more functionality is being moved to the browser to provide faster, more responsive user experiences. However, it's important to note that client-side code can be less secure than server-side code, as it is more accessible to attackers who can easily view and manipulate it using browser developer tools. Therefore, it's important to follow best practices and security guidelines when developing client-side code.
