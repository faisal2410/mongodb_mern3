An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) uses various notations and symbols to represent entities, relationships, attributes, and cardinality in a database schema. The most commonly used notations in ERD are:

Entity symbol: It represents an object, concept, or thing in the database, and is represented by a rectangle with rounded corners.

Attribute symbol: It represents a characteristic or property of an entity, and is represented by an oval shape connected to the entity symbol by a line.

Relationship symbol: It represents the association between two or more entities, and is represented by a diamond shape. The diamond shape is connected to the entity symbols by lines.

Cardinality notation: It represents the number of instances of one entity that are associated with the number of instances of another entity in a relationship. The cardinality notation is usually represented by small numbers or symbols next to the lines that connect the entity symbols to the relationship symbol.

Primary key symbol: It represents the unique identifier for an entity in the database, and is represented by an underlined attribute symbol.

Foreign key symbol: It represents a reference to the primary key of another entity, and is represented by an attribute symbol connected to the relationship symbol by a line.

Crow's foot notation: It is a graphical notation used to represent the cardinality of a relationship. The notation is represented by a crow's foot symbol next to the entity symbol.

These notations help to visualize the database schema and understand the relationships between entities, attributes, and relationships. They also help to ensure that the database design is accurate and efficient.
