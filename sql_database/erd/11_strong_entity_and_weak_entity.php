In Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) modeling, entities can be classified into two types: strong entities and weak entities.

A strong entity is an entity that can exist independently and has a unique identifier, also known as a primary key. In other words, a strong entity can be identified by its own attributes without depending on another entity. For example, in a university database, a Student entity can exist independently and has its own unique student ID as the primary key.

On the other hand, a weak entity is an entity that cannot exist independently and depends on another entity for its existence. A weak entity does not have a unique identifier on its own and instead has a partial key, which is a combination of its own attributes and the primary key of the entity it depends on. For example, in a university database, a Course Offering entity may depend on the Course entity for its existence, as a Course Offering cannot exist without the Course it belongs to.

To represent weak entities in ERD, a double rectangle symbol is used to denote a weak entity, while a dashed underline is used to denote its partial key. The relationship between a weak entity and its owner entity is represented by a solid diamond symbol, with a line connecting the owner entity to the weak entity.

In summary, strong entities are entities that can exist independently with a unique identifier, while weak entities depend on another entity for their existence and do not have a unique identifier on their own. ERD modeling distinguishes between strong and weak entities to better represent their relationships and dependencies in a database.
