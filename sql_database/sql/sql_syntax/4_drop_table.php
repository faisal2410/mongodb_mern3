/*
In SQL, the "DROP TABLE" syntax is used to delete an entire table from a database. It permanently removes the table structure and all of its data.

The syntax for "DROP TABLE" is:

DROP TABLE table_name;
Where "table_name" is the name of the table that you want to delete.

It's important to note that once you execute the "DROP TABLE" command, the table and all of its data will be permanently deleted, and it cannot be undone. Therefore, it's recommended that you use this command with caution and only when you are absolutely sure that you want to delete the table.
