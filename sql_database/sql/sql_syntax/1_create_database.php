/*
The syntax for creating a database in SQL is:

CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Where "database_name" is the name you want to give to your new database.

For example, if you want to create a database called "my_database", you would use the following SQL query:


CREATE DATABASE my_database;
Note that depending on the SQL implementation you're using, there may be additional options or parameters you can specify when creating a database, such as setting a character set or specifying a data directory.
