In SQL, the "SELECT" statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It's used to query the database and retrieve specific data that meets certain criteria.

The basic syntax for "SELECT" is:


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Where "column1, column2, ..." are the names of the columns you want to retrieve data from, and "table_name" is the name of the table you want to query. The "WHERE" clause specifies the criteria for selecting the rows to be returned.

For example, if you want to retrieve the names and salaries of all employees in the "employees" table with a salary greater than 50000, you can use the following syntax:


SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

This will retrieve the "name" and "salary" columns from the "employees" table where the "salary" column is greater than 50000.

You can also use the "SELECT" statement to retrieve data from multiple tables by using "JOIN" clauses. For example, if you have two tables, "employees" and "departments", and you want to retrieve the name and department of each employee, you can use the following syntax:


SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

This will retrieve the "name" column from the "employees" table and the "department_name" column from the "departments" table, where the "department_id" column of the "employees" table matches the "department_id" column of the "departments" table.

Overall, the "SELECT" statement is a powerful tool for retrieving data from one or more tables in a database, and it's commonly used in various database applications.
