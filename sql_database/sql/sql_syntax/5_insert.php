In SQL, the "INSERT" syntax is used to add data to a table. It's used to insert one or more rows of data into a specific table in a database.

The basic syntax for "INSERT" is:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

Where "table_name" is the name of the table you want to insert data into, and "column1, column2, column3, ..." are the column names of the table you want to insert data into.

You can also use the following syntax to insert data into all columns of a table:


INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

Where "table_name" is the name of the table you want to insert data into, and "value1, value2, value3, ..." are the actual values you want to insert into the table.

It's important to make sure that the data you're inserting matches the data type of the columns in the table. Otherwise, you may encounter errors when trying to insert the data.

Overall, the "INSERT" syntax is a fundamental part of SQL, and it's used extensively in database operations.
