A query is a request for information from a database or other data storage system. It is a command or set of commands that specifies what data the user wants to retrieve or manipulate.

Queries are used to search for specific information within a dataset, extract data that meets certain criteria, or calculate values based on data in the database. They can be simple or complex, depending on the complexity of the data being queried and the desired output.

In databases, queries are typically written in a query language such as SQL, which allows users to interact with the database by entering commands to retrieve or manipulate data. Other types of data storage systems may use different query languages or methods for interacting with the data.

Overall, queries are an essential tool for working with data in databases and other data storage systems, allowing users to extract the information they need quickly and efficiently.

Query language is a programming language used to interact with databases or other data storage systems. It allows users to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in the system. There are several types of query languages, including:

Structured Query Language (SQL): This is the most common query language and is used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. SQL is a declarative language, which means that the user specifies what data they want to retrieve, and the database management system figures out how to retrieve it.

XQuery: This query language is used to query and manipulate data in XML documents. It is a functional language that allows users to specify how to retrieve and manipulate data.

SPARQL: This query language is used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF (Resource Description Framework) databases. It is similar to SQL in that it is declarative, but it is designed specifically for working with RDF data.

GraphQL: This query language is used to retrieve and manipulate data from APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It is a flexible language that allows users to specify the data they want to retrieve and the structure in which they want to receive it.

In summary, query languages are used to interact with databases or other data storage systems to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data. The specific type of query language used depends on the type of data being queried and the system in which it is stored.

QUEL (Query Language) and QBE (Query by Example) are two different query languages that were developed to interact with databases.

QUEL is a database query language that was developed by the Ingres Corporation in the 1970s. It was designed to be used with the Ingres relational database management system (RDBMS). QUEL is a declarative language, meaning that the user specifies what data they want to retrieve, and the database management system figures out how to retrieve it. QUEL is not widely used today, but it was influential in the development of Structured Query Language (SQL), which has become the de facto standard for database query languages.

QBE, on the other hand, is a graphical query language that allows users to query databases by constructing a graphical representation of the desired data. QBE was first introduced by IBM in the 1970s as part of the prototype for the System R database management system. In QBE, the user creates a visual representation of the data they want to retrieve by specifying the tables and columns they want to query and the conditions they want to apply. QBE is often used by non-technical users because it does not require the user to write complex queries in a programming language.

Overall, QUEL and QBE are two different query languages that were developed to interact with databases. QUEL is a programming language that is used to query databases in a declarative manner, while QBE is a graphical query language that allows users to construct queries by creating a visual representation of the data they want to retrieve. While QUEL is not widely used today, it was influential in the development of SQL, which has become the standard query language for relational databases.
