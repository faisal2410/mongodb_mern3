/*
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most widely used query language for interacting with relational databases. There are several types of SQL that are commonly used, including:

Data Definition Language (DDL): This type of SQL is used to define the structure of a database, including creating tables, defining their columns, and setting constraints on the data.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): This type of SQL is used to retrieve, add, update, and delete data in a database. It includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

Data Control Language (DCL): This type of SQL is used to manage user access to a database. It includes commands like GRANT and REVOKE, which are used to grant or revoke permissions to access the database.

Transaction Control Language (TCL): This type of SQL is used to manage transactions in a database. It includes commands like COMMIT, which is used to save changes made to the database, and ROLLBACK, which is used to undo changes made during a transaction.

Data Query Language (DQL): This type of SQL is used to retrieve data from a database. It includes the SELECT command, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.

Overall, these types of SQL provide a range of tools for interacting with and managing data in a relational database. Depending on the task at hand, a developer or database administrator may need to use one or more of these SQL types to create, manage, and query a database effectively.
